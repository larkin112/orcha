## How to Use

1. **Customize Modules:** Adapt the modules (CRM, HRM, SCM, PM) based on your ERP requirements.
2. **Map Data Entities:** Ensure each feature references its underlying data tables or sources.
3. **Define Workflows:** Draw lines or annotate triggers and automations between modules/integrations.
4. **Enforce Security:** Clearly indicate role-based access and data partitioning.
5. **Visualize Integrations:** Draw or list all key integrations with external systems.

---

## Notes

- Each ERP module may be a separate AppSheet app or a unified app with role-based views.
- Data is centralized or partitioned by module, depending on business needs.
- AppSheet Bots/Workflows orchestrate cross-module automation.
- Integrate with external services as needed for a complete ERP solution.
